# To-Do List Application

A simple and interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps users add, manage, and delete tasks easily. It also utilizes `localStorage` to save the tasks, so your list remains even after you close the browser.

## Features
- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to the list by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Click on a task to mark it as completed, which adds a visual check to indicate its status.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks by clicking the "Ã—" symbol next to each task.
- **Persistent Data:** Tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage` so that your list persists even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** For styling the to-do list and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** For functionality, including adding, deleting, and toggling tasks, as well as storing tasks in `localStorage`.
